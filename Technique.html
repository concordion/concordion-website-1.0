<h1>Write specifications, not scripts</h1>

<p class="subtext">
Hide all scripting activity in the Java fixture code.
</p>

<a name="scripts"> </a>
<h2>Scripts over-specify</h2>
<p>
Test scripts are a list of instructions to be followed. For example:
</p>

<blockquote class="badExample">
Clear database
<br/>Load database from "sample-data.sql"
<br/>Start webserver
<br/>Open URL: http://localhost:8080/myapp
<br/>Enter username: admin
<br/>Enter password: admin1
<br/>Click the "Login" button
<br/>Click the "User Administration" link
<br/>Click the "Create User" button:
<br/>Enter name: John Smith
<br/>Enter username: john
<br/>Enter password: john99
<br/>Click the "OK" button
<br/>Click the "Logout" link
<br/>Enter username: john
<br/>Enter password: john99
<br/>Click the "Login" button
<br/>Check page contains text: Hello John!
</blockquote>

<p>
Concealed inside the script is a behaviour that the test is trying to
demonstrate. But because the requirement is not explicit, it's hard to
know what it is (e.g. "Can we change this link to a button,
or is the link part of the requirement?").
</p>

<p>
Scripts also tend to suffer badly from duplication. If we introduce
an extra step into the authentication process then all the scripts that
mention logging-in will need modification. This is exactly the kind of
duplication that programming languages are designed to address and why
plain English is not a good language for scripting.
</p>

<a name="specFreedom"> </a>
<h2>Specifications give you freedom</h2>
<p>
Specifications tell you the requirements explicitly. They are
written at a higher level of abstraction to test scripts.
For example:
</p>

<blockquote class="goodExample">
    When John logs in, a greeting "Hello John!" is displayed.
</blockquote>

<p>
This can be implemented in multiple ways. All of the details about
how to test the requirement are hidden inside the fixture code
where they can be refactored as the system evolves.
</p>

<p>

<a name="specStable"> </a>
<h1>Specifications should be stable</h1>

<p class="subtext">
The specifications themselves should rarely change. Even on agile projects,
though new behaviour is added frequently, existing behaviour is normally
maintained from iteration to iteration.
</p>

<h2>Decouple using the fixture as a go-between</h2>
<p>
    Let the fixture code act as a buffer so that the specifications stay very stable.
    Anything implementation-specific should be hidden in the fixture code.
    You should find that the majority of specifications
    are written once and never changed.
</p>

<img id="specFixtureSystem" src="image/technique/SpecFixtureSystem-Gray.png"/>

<a name="instrumentationStable"> </a>
<h2>Instrumentation should not change either</h2>
<p>
    The job of the instrumentation is to translate the examples in the
    specification into method calls into the fixture.
    The instrumentation should be very simple and should not show any
    knowledge of how the behaviour is actually implemented in the
    system. Once written, the public interface of the fixture should
    not change; the implementation of its methods may change though.
</p>

<a name="keepSpecsSimple"> </a>
<h2>Only reveal data the specification actually needs</h2>
<p>
    In general, it's better not to return domain objects directly from
    fixture methods, but return strings or small objects containing just
    the values needed for the examples in the specification. The interfaces
    of domain objects may change and we want to avoid having to make
    changes to the instrumentation.
</p>

<p>
    For example, don't reference a deep property of a domain object from
    the instrumentation:
</p>
<blockquote class="badExample">
<code>order.phoneLine.phoneNumber</code>
<br/><code>order.phoneLine.location.postcode</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
    But, instead create a new inner class in the fixture that has the
    exact properties needed, and populate it from the domain object.
    This decouples the specifications from the domain model and gives
    you the flexibility to improve the model.
</p>

<blockquote class="goodExample">
<code>phoneNumber</code>
<br/><code>postcode</code>
</blockquote>

<br />
<a name="evolveDSL"> </a>
<h1>Evolve a domain-specific language</h1>

<p>
    As you write the fixture code, and refactor it to remove duplication,
    you'll find you gradually build up a scripting API &#150; a domain-specific
    language (DSL) &#150; that lets you manipulate the system under test.
    Eventually, the fixture code will become very stable too.
</p>

<img id="specFixtureSystem" src="image/technique/SpecFixtureScriptingSystem-Gray.png"/>

<br />

<a name="isolateBehaviours"> </a>
<h1>Isolate behaviours</h1>

<p>
    Each active specification should have a narrow focus and cover a single
    behaviour as independently as possible from other behaviours.
    For example, one specification might describe how text searches
    are case-insensitive, another will describe how date searches work,
    and another will describe how search results are to be presented (what
    data is displayed). The idea is to keep each specification very simple
    and to avoid overlaps, so that we can change the specification about
    the way search results are presented without having to make changes
    to the other specifications.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to test a combination of behaviours, write a separate
    specification of the behaviour for the combination. But always write
    the specifications for the individual behaviours first. When you
    combine behaviours there is a penalty in terms of complexity &#150;
    of both the specification and the fixture code to support it.
</p>


<br />

<a name="thinkGWT"> </a>
<h1>Think "Given-When-Then"</h1>

<p>
    This is an excellent way of structuring the concrete
    examples in the specifications, and getting into the mindset of
    specifying instead of scripting.
    I believe it was <a class="externalLink" href="http://dannorth.net/">Dan North</a> and
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://abc.truemesh.com/">Chris Matts</a> who came up with
    the template:
</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>Given</b> (some context)
    <br/><b>When</b> (something happens)
    <br/><b>then</b> (some behaviour)
    </blockquote>

<p>
    Example:
</p>

    <blockquote class="goodExample">
    Given a user called John;
    <br/>When John logs in,
    <br/>then a greeting is displayed saying "Hello John!".
    </blockquote>

<p>
    Once you've written or thought about your behaviour using the Given-When-Then template,
    you can reword the sentence to make it less clunky. For example, in this case
    we can deduce that John is a user from the phrase "John logs in", so we can drop
    the "Given" part and write something more readable like this:
</p>

    <blockquote class="goodExample">
    When John logs in, a greeting
    "Hello John!" is displayed.

<h1>Common Smells</h1>

<div class="memo">

<a name="specsChange"> </a>
<h1>Existing specifications are often changed</h1>

<h2>You're tied to an implementation</h2>
<p>
    If you find you're having to change the contents of specifications /
    instrumentation, on a regular basis, this is a strong indicator
    that the specifications are too closely coupled to the implementation.
</p>

<h2>So, pretend there are multiple implementations</h2>
<p>
    The solution is to describe the underlying behaviour in a more
    abstract way. It might help
    to imagine that there are several different implementations - a web application,
    a Swing application, and a command-line executable, for example. Only
    describe behaviour that is <em>required</em> so that you leave as
    many options open as possible for alternative implementations.
</p>

<br />

<a name="lotsOfExecutes"> </a>
<h1>Lots of "execute" commands</h1>

<h2>You're writing a script</h2>
<p>
    If you have lots of "execute" commands you are probably writing
    a script instead of a specification.
</p>

<h2>So, hide the scripting in the fixture</h2>
<p>
    Avoid describing the steps of how to test
    the behaviour and simply state the context (as a sentence),
    and the behaviour you expect to see. Don't explain
    how to get into that context, don't explain how to perform the
    operation and don't explain how to extract the results. All of these
    things are implementation-specific and should be hidden in the
    fixture code.
</p>


<br />
<img style="float: right" src="image/technique/SmellyFish.png"/>

<a name="complicatedInstrumentation"> </a>
<h1>Complicated instrumentation</h1>

<h2>You're testing too much in one go</h2>
<p>
    As a rule of thumb, well-written fixtures should have no more than
    three public methods and no method should have more than one or two
    parameters. Complicated instrumentation is usually a sign of
    trying to test too many things at once.
</p>

<h2>So, decompose the behaviour</h2>
<p>
    Focus on one tiny behaviour at a time. Break the
    behaviour into smaller and smaller pieces until you cannot
    break it down any further. Then write separate specifications
    for each piece.
</p>

<br />

<img style="float: right" src="image/technique/SmellyFish.png"/>

<a name="complicatedFixtures"> </a>
<h1>Complicated fixture code</h1>

<h2>Your fixture code is verbose and hard to follow</h2>
<p>
    All the scripting should be done in the fixture code, but this
    can make the code seem complicated.
</p>

<h2>So, create classes to help with the scripting</h2>
<p>
    Begin to create objects to help with the scripting
    activity - push the implementation details into them. Eventually
    you'll create a little domain specific language (DSL).
</p>

<br />
<img style="float: right" src="image/technique/SmellyFish.png"/>

<a name="sameStructure"> </a>
<h1>Examples all have the same structure</h1>

<h2>Your examples are too generic</h2>
<p>
    If the examples in your specifications look very similar (i.e. they have
    the same kind of context set-up, the same kind of checks etc.) this is
    a strong sign that the examples are too generic.
</p>

<h2>So, focus the examples more carefully</h2>
<p>
    The examples should demonstrate the particular behaviour you are
    describing and should not include any irrelevant details. Push
    everything you can into the fixture code.
</p>

    <blockquote class="badExample">
    Given the following orders:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <table class="exampleTable">
        <tr>
            <th>Order ID</th>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Requester</th>
            <th>Date</th>
            <th>Service Level</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Active</td>
            <td>john.smith</td>
            <td>13-Oct-2007</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br />When order <b>1</b> is <b>cancelled</b>,
    <br />Then the orders become:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <table class="exampleTable">
        <tr>
            <th>Order ID</th>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Requester</th>
            <th>Date</th>
            <th>Service Level</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Cancelled</td>
            <td>john.smith</td>
            <td>13-Oct-2007</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

<p>
    The layout above is "one size fits all". It contains lots of
    context that is not relevant to the behaviour we want to show.
</p>

<p>
    Focusing the examples improves their clarity and reduces duplication:
</p>

    <blockquote class="goodExample">
    When an <b>Active</b> order is cancelled,
    its status is displayed as <b>Cancelled</b>.
