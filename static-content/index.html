<ul class="keyBenefits">
<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Tests can become <em>truly useful</em> documentation</span>
Concordion acceptance tests are so readable they can double up
as system documentation. They are written in HTML, so can be easily
hyperlinked into a navigable structure. And, since the tests run
against the system, you can be confident the documentation is always
up-to-date.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Helps you to separate "what?" from "how?"</span>
Tests that include a lot of implementation detail lock you into
that implementation. Concordion helps you to document the logic
and behaviour of your system in a way that gives you the flexibility
to change the implementation later on.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Purposely small command-set is simple to learn</span>
Concordion has been designed with a short learning-curve as a top priority.
The tests are also integrated with JUnit, which makes them easy to run and
easy to include in an existing project build.
</p>

<h1 style="width: 320px">What's special about it?</h1>


<div class="miniQuote">
    <span style="font-size: 22pt">&#8220;</span>Concordion is similar to
Cucumber but focuses on readability.<span style="font-size: 22pt">&#8221;</span>
</div>



<h2>Normal language, no need for structured "given/when/then"</h2>
<p style="width: 480px">
    Rather than forcing product owners to specify requirements in a
    specially structured language, Concordion lets you write them in normal
    language using paragraphs, tables and proper punctuation. This makes the
    specifications much more natural to read and write, and helps everyone
    to understand and agree about what a feature is supposed to do.
</p>

<h2>Attractive output</h2>
<p style="width: 480px">
    Concordion tests are written in HTML with an attractive stylesheet that
    makes them nice to read, and suitable for internal or even external
    documentation. You can use HTML features such as hyperlinks and images
    to make the pages even more useful.
</p>
<p>
    For an example, see <a href="dist/1.4.5/spec/concordion/Concordion.html">Concordion's own specifications</a>.
</p>


<h2>Always bang up-to-date</h2>
<p>
    Concordion specifications are <b>active</b>. Behind the scenes, they are
    linked to the system under test and therefore do not go out-of-date. If
    a change is made to the system's behaviour then the tests associated
    with the relevant specification will fail and let you know.
</p>


<p>
    <img src="image/concept/AnatomyOfAnActiveSpec.png"/>
</p>

<h2>Complex behaviours can be decomposed</h2>
<p>
        Each question at the bottom of the specification links to another
        active specification and so on until you have either run out of questions
        or the answer is "Out of Scope". In this way, a complex behaviour can
        be broken down into small, focused and easily understood requirements.
</p>


<br />

<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>
    <img style="padding-top: 24px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="image/concept/HowItWorks.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Specifications are written in simple HTML.
Developers instrument the concrete examples in each specification with
commands (e.g. "set", "execute", "assertEquals") that allow
the examples to be checked against a real-life system.
</p>

<p>
The instrumentation is invisible to a browser, but is processed by a
Java fixture class that accompanies the specification and
acts as a buffer between the specification and the system under
test. The fixture is also a JUnit test case, so it's easy to run and
integrate into an automated build. The results of running the examples are
exported with green and red indicating successes and failures.
</p>

<p>
Some example instrumentation:
</p>

<pre class="html">
&lt;p&gt;
    When &lt;span <b>concordion:set="#firstName"</b>&gt;Bob&lt;/span&gt; logs in a greeting
    &lt;span <b>concordion:assertEquals="greetingFor(#firstName)"</b>&gt;Hello Bob!&lt;/span&gt;
    should be displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>


<br />

<h1>Technique</h1>

<p class="subtext">
    With the right technique, active specifications can boost agility and make it
    easier to sustain a test-driven approach.
</p>

<h2>Separating requirements from implementation helps refactoring</h2>
<p>
Hiding all the implementation-specific detail inside the Java fixture
code gives you freedom to
change the internal design of
your application confident that you'll catch inadvertent changes
to required behaviour. The specifications don't
change when you refactor.
</p>

<p>
One problem with unit tests is that they mix together
customer requirements with tests of internal classes. With active
specifications you make a clear distinction and it's much easier to know
what's truly important and what can be changed. The specifications
describe the customer requirements whereas the test fixtures verify internal
implementation.
</p>

<h2>Specifications can be as thorough as unit tests</h2>
<p>
Specifications can cover every nuance of behaviour that is important
to the customer. There is no reason why the specifications cannot do
this to the same depth as JUnit tests. But instead of the onus being
on the developer to think up all the fine-detail tests, with active
specifications, testers and analysts can also get involved.
</p>

<h2>Specifications can be hooked in at different levels</h2>
<p>
The fixture code can be hooked in at unit, component, sub-system or
system level depending on the level of confidence required traded
against speed of test execution. The decision does not affect the
specifications themselves. They just describe the behaviour without
explaining how it's implemented or how to test it.
</p>


<h2>Agreeing details up-front allows finer control over scope</h2>
<p>
Active specifications can be used to define detailed acceptance criteria
for a story. This allows the product owner to make decisions about
scope and behaviour that would otherwise be left to the programmers.
This reduces gold-plating and allows the product owner to make conscious
trade-offs of scope against development cost. E.g. "Let's not handle
this [edge case] in this iteration as it's very unlikely to happen,
and there are other stories that I want implemented that offer more
value".
</p>



<h2>Test coverage no longer relies on developer self-discipline</h2>

<p>
Automated unit tests, written by developers, are at the heart of most
traditional agile approaches. Unfortunately, because unit tests are
neither visible to management nor the product owner, there's always
a feeling of pressure to cut corners for short-term gains in
development speed. In the long-term this can be fatal for agility,
but it takes constant willpower to resist the temptation and many
agile projects eventually succumb.
</p>

<p>
Driving a project with active specifications reduces
this problem. Since the specifications are written in plain language,
not only are they readable and visible outside of the development
team, but they are also co-authored with the product owner and
testers. Keeping the quality high becomes a group effort.
</p>

<p>
Developers may continue to write some unit tests to drive aspects
of the internal design but the project no longer relies on them for
test coverage of external behaviour. The active specifications
take over that role. Since writing the specifications is at the core
of the visible process &#8211; nothing is developed without active
specifications describing the requirements &#8211; it becomes practically
impossible to cut corners.
</p>

<p><a href="Example.html">Worked example</a></p>


<br />
<h1>Where is Concordion suitable and not suitable?</h1>

<p class="subtext">
    No product is perfect for everyone and Concordion is no exception.
</p>

<h2>Concordion is not a tester-only tool</h2>

<p>
Concordion is not suitable for testers who don't have access to developers
or development skills. The test specs can be written by non-developers, but
the instrumentation and fixture code require Java programming ability.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind the product is to allow (non-developer) testers and developers
to collaborate in a way that draws on the strengths of both without needing to
step on each others toes.
</p>

<p>
It can, however, be used by developers on their own, as an alternative to
writing JUnit tests. The advantage of doing this, is that helps to separate the
two concerns: separating the requirements from the implementation.
</p>

<h2>Concordion test specs are written in HTML</h2>

<p>
Only a very small subset of HTML is needed (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;b&gt;),
however, some people may be intimidated by it or not want to write in HTML.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes developers <em>imagine</em> that testers or business analysts won't
want to learn to write HTML, but in reality it's not a problem.
The crash course, below, describes enough HTML for writing the majority of specifications
and takes most people only a few minutes to get their head round.
</p>

<p>
If for some reason, it's not possible to persuade a tester or analyst to write in HTML,
workable alternatives are for developers to sit with the analysts and testers and
"do the typing" (i.e. write the basic HTML for them) or to take or accept notes in
other formats and write them up in HTML.
</p>

</div> <!-- memo -->


<div class="crashCourse">
<div><b>Crash Course in HTML</b></div>
<p>HTML documents are written in text with special start and end tags around items.
For example:</p>
<div style="padding: 8px; background-color: white"><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></div>

<p>The tag &lt;p&gt; signals the start of the paragraph and &lt;/p&gt; signals the end.</p>

<p>You can nest tags.</p>

<div style="padding: 8px; background-color: white"><code>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt; in a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></div>

<p>When the document is displayed in a web browser, it will be rendered like this:</p>

<div style="padding: 8px; background-color: white">This is <b>bold</b> text in a paragraph</div>

<p>The syntax for a table is more complicated, but once you understand this,
you'll have everything you need to write tests in Concordion.</p>

<p>A table uses the following tags: &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; (table row) , &lt;th&gt; (table heading), &lt;td&gt; (table data).
The table is expressed row by row. The first row contains the headings, the following rows are data. For example:</p>


<pre style="padding: 8px; background-color: white; margin: 0;">
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Fred Flintstone&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Betty Rubble&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>

<p>Which produces:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fred Flintstone</td>
        <td>35</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Betty Rubble</td>
        <td>27</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h1>Spelling of Concordion</h1>

<p>
   Several people said they couldn't find this page when they
   searched because they were spelling "Concordion"
   as Concordium or Concordian. Hopefully, now we have written the words
   Concordium and Concordian on this page the search engines will find it
   even with the misspelling.
