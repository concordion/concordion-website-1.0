<ul class="keyBenefits">
<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Specifications become <em>living documentation</em></span> 
Concordion specifications are so readable they can double up as system 
documentation. They are written in HTML, so can be easily hyperlinked into a 
navigable structure. 
</p>
<p>
The specifications contain examples of behaviour which, when automated and executed against your system, are colour-coded by Concordion to show whether the examples are working. By executing these frequently, you can be confident your documentation is always up-to-date with your system.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Helps you to separate &quot;what?&quot; from &quot;how?&quot;</span>
Specifications that include a lot of implementation detail lock you into that 
implementation. Concordion helps you to document the logic and behaviour of your 
system in a way that gives you the flexibility to change the implementation 
later on.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Purposely small command-set is simple to learn</span>
Concordion based on <em>specification by example</em> has been designed with a short learning-curve as a top priority. 
Automated examples are executed as JUnit tests, which makes them easy to run and easy 
to include in an existing project build.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Powerful extension framework for customisation</span>
While the core features are kept deliberately small, the <a href="ExtensionsAPI.html">extensions API</a> allows you to add functionality. For example, using <a href="https://github.com/concordion/concordion-excel-extension">Excel spreadsheets as specifications</a>, adding <a href="https://github.com/concordion/concordion-screenshot-extension">screenshots</a> to the output,
displaying <a href="https://github.com/concordion/concordion-logging-tooltip-extension">logging</a> information, and <a href="Extensions.html">much more</a>.

<h1 style="width: 320px">What's special about it?</h1>


<div class="miniQuote">
    <span style="font-size: 22pt">&#8220;</span>Concordion is similar to Cucumber but 
	focuses on readability.<span style="font-size: 22pt">&#8221;</span>
</div>



<h2>Normal language, no need for structured &quot;given/when/then&quot;</h2>
<p style="width: 480px">
    Rather than forcing product owners to use a specially structured language for 
	specification by example, Concordion lets you write the specifications in normal language 
	using paragraphs, tables and proper punctuation. This makes them 
	much more natural to read and write, and helps everyone 
	understand and agree about what a feature is supposed to do.
</p>

<h2>Attractive output</h2>
<p style="width: 480px">
    Concordion specifications are written in HTML with an attractive stylesheet 
	that makes them nice to read, and suitable for internal or even external 
	documentation. You can use HTML features such as hyperlinks and images to 
	make the pages even more useful.
</p>
<p>
    For an example, see <a href="dist/1.5.1/spec/concordion/Concordion.html">
	Concordion's own specifications</a>.
</p>


<h2>Always bang up-to-date</h2>
<p>
    Concordion specifications are <b>active</b>. Behind the scenes, they are 
	linked to the system under test and therefore do not go out-of-date. If a 
	change is made to the system's behaviour then the tests associated with the 
	relevant specification will fail and let you know.
</p>


<p>
    <img src="image/concept/AnatomyOfAnActiveSpec.png" alt="specification by example" title="Specification by Example"/>
</p>

<h2>Complex behaviours can be decomposed</h2>
<p>
        Each question at the bottom of the specification links to another active 
		specification and so on until you have either run out of questions or 
		the answer is &quot;Out of Scope&quot;. In this way, a complex behaviour can be 
		broken down into small, focused and easily understood requirements.
</p>


<br />

<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>
    <img style="padding-top: 24px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="image/concept/HowItWorks.png"
    alt="acceptance testing" title="Acceptance Testing"/>
</p>

<p>
Specifications with examples are written in simple HTML. Developers instrument the 
concrete examples in each specification with commands (e.g. &quot;set&quot;, &quot;execute&quot;, 
&quot;assertEquals&quot;) that allow the examples to be checked against a real-life 
system.
</p>

<p>
The instrumentation is invisible to a browser, but is processed by a Java 
fixture class that accompanies the specification and acts as a buffer between 
the specification and the system under test. The fixture is also a JUnit test 
case, so it's easy to run and integrate into an automated build. The results of 
running the examples are exported with green and red indicating successes and 
failures.
</p>

<p>
Some example instrumentation:
</p>

<pre class="html">
&lt;p&gt;
    When &lt;span <b>concordion:set=&quot;#firstName&quot;</b>&gt;Bob&lt;/span&gt; logs in a greeting
    &lt;span <b>concordion:assertEquals=&quot;greetingFor(#firstName)&quot;</b>&gt;Hello Bob!&lt;/span&gt;
    should be displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>


<br />

<h1>Technique</h1>

<p class="subtext">
    With the right technique, active specifications can boost agility and make 
	it easier to sustain a test-driven approach.
</p>

<h2>Separating requirements from implementation helps refactoring</h2>
<p>
Hiding all the implementation-specific detail inside the Java fixture code gives 
you freedom to change the internal design of your application confident that 
you'll catch inadvertent changes to required behaviour. The specifications don't 
change when you refactor.
</p>

<p>
One problem with unit tests is that they mix together customer requirements with 
tests of internal classes. With active specifications you make a clear 
distinction and it's much easier to know what's truly important and what can be 
changed. The specifications describe the customer requirements whereas the test 
fixtures verify internal implementation.
</p>

<h2>Specifications can be as thorough as unit tests</h2>
<p>
Specifications can cover every nuance of behaviour that is important to the 
customer. There is no reason why the specifications cannot do this to the same 
depth as JUnit tests. But instead of the onus being on the developer to think up 
all the fine-detail tests, with active specifications, testers and analysts can 
also get involved.
</p>

<h2>Specifications can be hooked in at different levels</h2>
<p>
The fixture code can be hooked in at unit, component, sub-system or system level 
depending on the level of confidence required traded against speed of test 
execution. The decision does not affect the specifications themselves. They just 
describe the behaviour without explaining how it's implemented or how to test 
it.
</p>


<h2>Agreeing details up-front allows finer control over scope</h2>
<p>
Active specifications can be used to define detailed acceptance criteria for a 
story. This allows the product owner to make decisions about scope and behaviour 
that would otherwise be left to the programmers. This reduces gold-plating and 
allows the product owner to make conscious trade-offs of scope against 
development cost. E.g. &quot;Let's not handle this [edge case] in this iteration as 
it's very unlikely to happen, and there are other stories that I want 
implemented that offer more value&quot;.
</p>



<h2>Test coverage no longer relies on developer self-discipline</h2>

<p>
Automated unit tests, written by developers, are at the heart of most 
traditional agile approaches. Unfortunately, because unit tests are neither 
visible to management nor the product owner, there's always a feeling of 
pressure to cut corners for short-term gains in development speed. In the 
long-term this can be fatal for agility, but it takes constant willpower to 
resist the temptation and many agile projects eventually succumb.
</p>

<p>
Driving a project with active specifications reduces this problem. Since the 
specifications are written in plain language, not only are they readable and 
visible outside of the development team, but they are also co-authored with the 
product owner and testers. Keeping the quality high becomes a group effort.
</p>

<p>
Developers may continue to write some unit tests to drive aspects of the 
internal design but the project no longer relies on them for test coverage of 
external behaviour. The active specifications take over that role. Since writing 
the specifications is at the core of the visible process &#8211; nothing is developed 
without active specifications describing the requirements &#8211; it becomes 
practically impossible to cut corners.

<h1>Where is Concordion suitable and not suitable?</h1>

<p class="subtext">
    No product is perfect for everyone and Concordion is no exception.
</p>

<h2>Concordion is not a tester-only tool</h2>

<p>
Concordion is not suitable for testers who don't have access to developers or 
development skills. The specifications can be written by non-developers, but the 
instrumentation and fixture code require Java programming ability.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind the product is to allow (non-developer) testers and developers 
to collaborate in a way that draws on the strengths of both without needing to 
step on each others toes.
</p>

<p>
It can, however, be used by developers on their own, as an alternative to 
writing JUnit tests. The advantage of doing this, is that helps to separate the 
two concerns: separating the requirements from the implementation.
</p>

<h2>Concordion specifications are written in HTML</h2>

<p>
Only a very small subset of HTML is needed (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;b&gt;), however, some 
people may be intimidated by it or not want to write in HTML.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes developers <em>imagine</em> that testers or business analysts won't 
want to learn to write HTML, but in reality it's not a problem. The crash 
course, below, describes enough HTML for writing the majority of specifications 
and takes most people only a few minutes to get their head round.
</p>

<p>
If for some reason, it's not possible to persuade a tester or analyst to write 
in HTML, workable alternatives are for developers to sit with the analysts and 
testers and &quot;do the typing&quot; (i.e. write the basic HTML for them) or to take or 
accept notes in other formats and write them up in HTML.
</p>

<div class="crashCourse">
<div><b>Crash Course in HTML</b></div>
<p>HTML documents are written in text with special start and end tags around 
items. For example:</p>
<div style="padding: 8px; background-color: white"><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a 
	paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></div>

<p>The tag &lt;p&gt; signals the start of the paragraph and &lt;/p&gt; signals the end.</p>

<p>You can nest tags.</p>

<div style="padding: 8px; background-color: white"><code>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;b&gt;bold 
	text&lt;/b&gt; in a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></div>

<p>When the document is displayed in a web browser, it will be rendered like 
this:</p>

<div style="padding: 8px; background-color: white">This is <b>bold</b> text in a 
	paragraph</div>

<p>The syntax for a table is more complicated, but once you understand this, 
you'll have everything you need to write tests in Concordion.</p>

<p>A table uses the following tags: &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; (table row) , &lt;th&gt; (table 
heading), &lt;td&gt; (table data). The table is expressed row by row. The first row 
contains the headings, the following rows are data. For example:</p>


<pre style="padding: 8px; background-color: white; margin: 0;">
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Fred Flintstone&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Betty Rubble&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>

<p>Which produces:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fred Flintstone</td>
        <td>35</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Betty Rubble</td>

<h1>Spelling of Concordion</h1>

<p>
   Several people said they couldn't find this page when they searched because 
   they were spelling &quot;Concordion&quot; as concordium, concordian. 
   Hopefully, now we have written the words Concordium and Concordian on this page the search engines will find it even with the misspelling.
